### Homework 2 Part 3
#### David Nixon

#### Question 1
This piece of code performs some basic arithmetic operations and eventually prints the number 14.

To be precise, it multiplies the values 5 and 3 together to get 15, divides the value 3 by 2 to get 1, and then subtracts
the two numbers to get 14.

#### Question 2
This piece of code scans through a list of values and stores the value if it is higher than the current maximum value.
It then prints the maximum of the list of values.

#### Question 3
This piece of code scans through each number from 0 to 999, and prints out the numbers which match the summation
of the cubed value of 3 numbers which began as the current value from 0 to 999 but have had a number of operations 
performed on them. The program prints the values 153, 370, 371, and 407.

#### Question 4
This piece of code starts by populating a list with the values from 0 to 99. The piece of code then calls another function
using this list, the value 100, and the value 7 as inputs. I do not know the functionality of this second function.
When this function terminates, the main function prints its return value.
